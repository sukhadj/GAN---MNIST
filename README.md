## GAN - MNIST

### Implementation of generative adversial network on MNIST

Generative adversial networks are deep neural networks comprised of two networks - generator and discriminator.
Generator network generates new data instances while discriminator evaluates them for authenticity.

Given script trains the GAN on MNIST dataset and generates the data.
